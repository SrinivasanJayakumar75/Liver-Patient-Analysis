Created a model that evaluates whether the patient has liver
disease or not.
Early prediction of liver disease using classification algorithms is an
efficacious task that can help the doctors to diagnose the disease
within a short duration of time.
Therefore, the goal of this work is to evaluate the performance of
different Machine Learning algorithms in order to reduce the high
cost of liver disease diagnosis.
Tools : python, scikit-learn, tensorflow, pandas, seaborn
